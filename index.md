Empathy–Psychological Imbalance–Drive Theory, Arguing for the Inherent Goodness of Human Nature

Abstract

Traditional moral psychology has long failed to reveal the internal motivational mechanism by which empathy transforms into benevolent actions and good deeds. Consequently, the proposition that "human nature is inherently good" has remained at the level of philosophical speculation, lacking rigorous scientific empirical evidence and theoretical proof. This paper originally proposes the Empathy–Psychological Imbalance–Drive theoretical model for the first time. It systematically constructs a complete motivational chain linking empathy, psychological imbalance, drive, and benevolent action. It uniformly explains the occurrence patterns of human benevolent behaviors from multiple scenarios. These scenarios include individual emergency good deeds, deliberate extreme good deeds, disaster relief group good deeds, and social event group good deeds.

This paper strictly adheres to the basic principles of motivational psychology, cognitive dissonance theory, drive reduction theory, and social learning theory. For the first time, it uses psychological logic to prove that the inherent goodness of human nature is not a subjective moral assumption. Rather, it is an innate psychological instinct of humans. This paper integrates the Eastern wisdom of mind and nature represented by Confucius and Mencius. It also echoes Western thinkers such as Rousseau, Locke, Emerson, Rogers, and Maslow.

This research fills a long-standing theoretical gap in the international field of moral psychology. The theory is concise, logically rigorous, and possesses strong explanatory power. It holds significant original value, contemporary value, and value for human civilization.

I. Theoretical Foundation

1.1 The Evolution and Neural Basis of Empathy

Empathy is not a product of acquired education. It is a fundamental, instinctive emotional consciousness formed by humans during the long process of evolution to ensure group survival. The visual center, auditory center, and pain center are highly and precisely connected. This precise connection is the physiological basis of empathy. For example, when an individual sees or hears another person in distress, through the precise connection between the visual or auditory center and the pain center, the pain center produces a physiological response (a negative reaction). This physiological response, after rapid, active, and automatic processing by the brain, leads the individual to experience psychological pain. This is painful empathy. Conversely, seeing or hearing another person happy causes the pain center to produce the opposite reaction (a positive reaction), corresponding to joyful empathy.

This ability exists not only at the individual level. It can also form group empathy through emotional contagion and cognitive resonance. It becomes the psychological foundation for human group mutual aid and cooperation. It ensures that humans can survive and develop as a group during the evolutionary process.

1.2 The Mechanism of Psychological Balance Disruption (Spring Deformation Model)

When empathy (perceiving another's pain) and the specific situation of "need for help" appear simultaneously, it triggers a disruption of psychological balance. This is psychological imbalance. This imbalance directly manifests as inner tension, unease, and discomfort. It drives the individual to take proactive action to restore balance.

Psychological imbalance under group empathy is a collective manifestation of individual psychological imbalance. When a group collectively perceives the pain and need for help of a certain subject, and forms the collective cognition that "we have the ability to provide help," group psychological tension arises. This subsequently promotes the occurrence of benevolent actions at the group level.

1.3 Drive: The Core Motivation for Restoring Balance

The internal tension generated by psychological imbalance transforms into drive. According to drive reduction theory [3], the core function of drive is to eliminate tension and restore balance.

The intensity of drive is positively correlated with the intensity of empathy, the salience of the need, and the judgment of individual/group capability. The drive produced by group empathy is the convergence and amplification of individual drives. The psychological tension of each person superimposes, forming a stronger collective action motivation. It is further enhanced by social identity, shared responsibility, and emotional bonds.

1.4 The General Principle of Behavior Occurrence

Motivation drives behavior. This is a classic basic principle of psychology. American psychologist R.S. Woodworth (1918) first systematically proposed: Motivation is the internal force that arouses, sustains, and guides individual behavior [1]. This view has become a basic consensus in psychology.

The occurrence of any overt behavior must simultaneously satisfy two basic conditions: sufficient motivation + possessing executive ability. Motivation alone is not sufficient to necessarily produce behavior. Only when the intensity of internal motivation surpasses the individual's behavioral inhibition threshold, and the individual possesses the physical conditions, resource conditions, environmental conditions, and possibility for action in reality, can motivation stably transform into observable behavior.

Group empathy and group benevolent actions follow the same principle: sufficient group drive + the group possesses collaborative action capability. When a group forms a unified motivation for good, and possesses the objective conditions for resource integration and action coordination, group benevolent actions will occur. This is the extension and manifestation of individual behavioral laws at the group level.


II. The Core Theoretical Laws of This Paper

2.1 The Occurrence Path of Individual Conventional Empathetic Benevolent Action (Rescue Case)

Empathy + Need for Help → Disruption of Psychological Balance (Psychological Imbalance) → Drive to Restore Balance → Sufficient Drive + Possession of Rescue Capability → Occurrence of Benevolent Action → Restoration of Psychological Balance, Drive Disappears, Produces Pleasure

Explanation of Principle:

The basic laws of psychology indicate that behavior is driven by motivation. Only when motivation is sufficient and the individual possesses the ability to implement it can motivation transform into actual behavior [1].

Motivation originates from the disruption of psychological balance. Empathy itself does not necessarily lead to psychological imbalance. For example, when people watch a movie in the cinema, although they may experience strong empathy and even cry, it does not trigger psychological imbalance, nor does it produce motivation for benevolent action and corresponding behavior.

Then, when does empathy trigger psychological imbalance?

Only when empathy and a real need for help appear simultaneously is the original psychological balance broken. This produces psychological imbalance and the drive to restore balance. It is like a spring deforming, producing the elastic force to return to its original state. This drive is motivation.

The need for help mentioned in this paper refers to a situation where another person is truly in a difficult, dangerous, or painful situation in a real scene, objectively requiring others to take practical action for rescue, help, and intervention. Because of empathy, the bystander develops a need to help. Without empathy, the bystander would not develop this need.

When the bystander develops a need to help but does not implement help in reality, and the need is not satisfied, psychological imbalance is triggered. This then produces the drive to restore balance. Psychological imbalance is like spring deformation; it naturally produces the drive to restore balance [3].

Does the production of drive necessarily lead to rescue behavior? Actually, not necessarily. There are many bystanders, but often only one or two actually step forward to rescue. The reason is: although all bystanders produce drive, due to different psychological traits, each person's drive intensity is different. Those who successfully rescue must have drive strong enough to overcome the risks of rescue.

If the drive is sufficiently strong, does it necessarily lead to rescue behavior? Still, not necessarily.

A common phenomenon in life: A child falls into water. The mother cries and calls for help on the shore but does not jump into the water to save the child. The mother loves the child the most, and her rescue motivation is the strongest. But why doesn't she jump?

The fundamental reason is: The mother cannot swim; she does not possess rescue capability. She can only call to those around her, hoping someone capable will rescue. The mother knows she lacks the ability to rescue. She also understands that jumping into the water blindly cannot save the child. Therefore, she can only call for help.

If the mother could swim and possessed rescue capability, she would rescue without hesitation.

In other words, among the bystanders, those who can swim and possess rescue capability, driven by sufficiently strong drive, will implement rescue behavior.

For individual good deeds that occur rapidly, like saving someone from drowning, whether the underlying psychological imbalance completely belongs to the category of cognitive dissonance [2] still awaits further research in the future. This type of behavior lacks the time and process for rational cognitive thinking. Simply classifying it as cognitive dissonance seems difficult to fit the logic of real behavior occurrence. This issue can be left for subsequent researchers to deeply verify.

All the above are common facts in life. They completely conform to the basic principles of motivational psychology [1]:

When motivation is strong enough, and the individual possesses the ability to implement the behavior, the behavior will occur.

When the child is successfully rescued, the rescuer will feel relieved, and bystanders will cheer sincerely. The reason is: After the child is saved, the source of painful empathy disappears. The psychological imbalance triggered by empathy is restored. The drive naturally disappears. This is followed by a relaxed and pleasant experience, like tense muscles relaxing.

2.2 The Occurrence Path of Individual Non-Benevolent Action (Movie Crying Case)

Empathy + No Need for Help → No Psychological Imbalance Produced → No Drive Produced → No Benevolent Action Occurs

Empathy + No Need for Help → Automatic Physical and Behavioral Reactions (e.g., Crying)

Explanation of Principle:

In a movie-watching scenario, although the character's plight can trigger strong empathy in the audience, this scenario does not require the audience to implement real rescue behavior in reality. Therefore, it does not trigger psychological imbalance, nor does it produce the drive to restore balance [3]. Naturally, it does not produce the motivation for benevolent action or rescue behavior.

At this time, reactions like crying that appear in the audience are not controlled by conscious thought. They belong to emotional physiological reflexes. They are not benevolent actions driven by psychological imbalance.

2.3 The Occurrence Path of Individual Guilt

Empathy + Need for Help → Disruption of Psychological Balance (Psychological Imbalance) → Production of Drive → Possesses Ability to Implement Benevolent Action but Does Not → Negative Outcome → Psychological Imbalance Not Restored → Guilt Produced (even a sense of sin)

Explanation of Principle:

In this path, the individual has the ability to implement a benevolent action but does not act. This ultimately leads to a negative outcome (e.g., injury or death of the person involved).

At this time, the negative outcome and the original source of pain that triggered empathy superimpose. This forms a new, stronger source of pain, triggering more intense painful empathy.

Simultaneously, the original need for help remains unsatisfied. The state of psychological imbalance persists. The drive still exists.

The persistent existence of the psychological imbalance state itself is an important source of pain.

These pains superimpose. Added to moral judgment, they naturally produce guilt, remorse, and even a sense of sin. This persistent discomfort caused by the inconsistency between cognition and behavior is a typical experience of cognitive dissonance [2].

Special Note:

If the individual has tried their best to rescue but ultimately failed, and the person involved still meets with misfortune, the source of pain still exists. Negative emotions still exist. But guilt and a sense of sin are not produced.

Because the individual has met the requirements of the drive. The psychological imbalance is alleviated. There is no moral judgment of "having ability but not acting." Therefore, there is only grief, no guilt or sense of sin.

2.4 The Occurrence Path of Individual Extreme Empathy-Related Behavior

Extreme Empathy + Group Need for Help → Extreme Disruption of Psychological Balance (Psychological Imbalance) → Super-Strong Drive to Restore Balance → Drive Breaks Through the Threshold of Conventional Behavioral Boundaries + Possesses Objective Action Capability → Extreme Behavior Occurs → Psychological Balance is Restored in Stages, Drive is Released in Stages

Explanation of Principle:

Extreme behavior is different from conventional individual emergency good deeds. It is a behavior implemented by an individual after deep consideration, breaking through conventional behavioral boundaries, upon perceiving the persistent pain and need for help of others.

The core premise of this type of behavior contains two indispensable elements: First, disadvantaged groups face real difficulties. There exists an urgent, strong, and unmet need for help. Second, the actor has a strong, sincere, and uncontrollable internal need to help others and change the unfair situation.

This long-term repeated impact of cognition and emotion, plus the strong need for help, forms intense internal tension in their heart. This then triggers extreme psychological imbalance and the corresponding super-strong drive to restore balance [3].

Different from rapid, instinctive, emotion-dominated good deeds like saving someone from drowning, this psychological imbalance is formed by the individual after deep consideration. In essence, it belongs to cognitive dissonance [2]. But it also contains strong emotional factors. It is a deep psychological imbalance where cognition and emotion are highly intertwined. It is different from the immediate psychological imbalance in emergency situations.

Driven by deep psychological imbalance, the individual produces a super-strong drive to restore balance. Its intensity is far higher than that of conventional good deeds. It is strong enough to break through the individual's cognitive boundaries for conventional behavior and the threshold of daily behavioral rules. It becomes the core motivation [1] dominating the individual's behavior.


Luigi Mangione shot and killed Brian Thompson, the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare. Luigi Mangione, driven by a super-strong drive, implemented this extreme behavior after deep consideration. The core purpose of his action was not simple opposition or emotional venting. It was to issue a warning, promote the improvement of unreasonable conditions, fundamentally stop the persistent suffering of the people, respond to the need for help of disadvantaged groups, and fulfill his internal mission of helping others, thereby alleviating internal tension and restoring psychological balance.

After this type of extreme behavior occurs, the extreme psychological imbalance triggered by the group's need for help is restored in stages. The super-strong drive is also released in stages.

Although this type of behavior exceeds conventional forms, its core logic does not deviate from the theoretical framework of this paper: Empathy triggers psychological imbalance. Drive drives behavior to restore balance. It only differs significantly from conventional good deeds in the intensity of empathy, the formation process of psychological imbalance, and the level of drive. It is a specific manifestation of this theory in extreme situations.

Special Statement: All analyses of the Luigi Mangione incident in this paper are solely from a psychological perspective, exploring the internal mechanism of how empathy, psychological imbalance, and drive drive extreme behavior. They belong to pure theoretical mechanism explanation. All discussions in this paper do not constitute a defense of the legality or reasonableness of this violent act, nor are they used as a basis for judicial judgment. This paper does not advocate or support any violent, illegal, or extreme behavior. The related analysis is only used for psychological theoretical research and mechanism explanation.


2.5 The Occurrence Path of Group Empathetic Benevolent Action

Group Empathy + Group Need for Help → Disruption of Group Psychological Balance → Aggregated Group Drive → Aggregated Drive Meets Standard + Group Possesses Collaborative Action Capability → Group Benevolent Action Occurs → Group Psychological Balance is Restored, Collective Drive Disappears, Produces Group Pleasure/Sense of Achievement

Explanation of Principle:

Group empathy and group benevolent action are typical manifestations of empathic consciousness at the group level. They are the social extension of individual empathy.

When a social event triggers widespread group empathy, and forms the collective cognition that "the subject of rescue has a clear need for help, and the group possesses the capability for collaborative rescue," group psychological imbalance is triggered. This then produces the drive to restore balance, promoting the occurrence of group benevolent action.

Group empathy and group benevolent action can be divided into two major categories: disaster relief group benevolent action and social event group benevolent action. Both types of cases clearly confirm the core logic of this paper, making the argument for group empathy more complete.

Case 1: Group Benevolent Action in Disaster Relief – Spontaneous Public Rescue during the 2024 Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Rainstorm Disaster

In the 2024 Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei rainstorm disaster, affected people faced severe difficulties: houses washed away, material shortages, and life-threatening dangers.

Their plight, disseminated through various media channels, quickly triggered nationwide group empathy. People from different regions and professions perceived the suffering and need for help of the affected people through images, text, and videos. This formed the collective cognition: "They are in extremely dangerous situations and need external help."

This combination of group empathy and a clear group need for help triggered psychological imbalance at the group level. The psychological tension produced by each individual's empathy resonated collectively through online interaction and public opinion, superimposing into intense group psychological imbalance. The collective cognition that "we can provide help through donations, supplies, and on-site support" transformed this group psychological imbalance into aggregated group drive [3].

This aggregated drive is not a simple sum of individual drives. It is amplified and enhanced through social identity, shared responsibility, and emotional bonds. It becomes the core motivation [1] driving society-wide collaborative good deeds.

Simultaneously, China's well-developed transportation system, mature charitable organizations, and convenient online donation channels endowed the social group with efficient collaborative action capability. This met the behavioral occurrence condition of "aggregated drive meets standard + group possesses collaborative action capability." Consequently, it gave rise to comprehensive, multi-level group benevolent actions: people nationwide spontaneously donated money and supplies; civilian rescue teams traveled long distances to conduct life search and rescue; volunteers from all sectors rushed to the disaster area to provide logistical support; enterprises actively donated materials and rescue equipment...

When these group benevolent actions were implemented, the difficulties of the affected people were alleviated, and their life safety was ensured. The group psychological imbalance gradually recovered. The aggregated group drive also disappeared. Participants in the benevolent actions collectively experienced group pleasure and a sense of achievement. This psychological experience existed not only among those who went to the scene. Even ordinary people who only participated in online donations felt psychological satisfaction because "their actions helped the disaster area." This is essentially consistent with the pleasure after individual good deeds. It is the inevitable result after the restoration of group psychological balance.

Case 2: Group Benevolent Action in Social Events – Public Street Protest Actions Triggered by the Luigi Mangione Incident

After the Luigi Mangione incident was fully exposed by the media, the original intention behind his actions—speaking for the suffering people—was quickly perceived and recognized by the public.

Furthermore, the public generally believed he was likely to be severely punished for this action. This formed the collective cognition: "This young man spoke for the people but faces fatal punishment. He himself is in an extreme survival dilemma and needs external support and help." This in turn triggered large-scale group empathy.

This combination of group empathy and a clear need for help triggered psychological imbalance at the group level. Countless people experienced individual psychological tension due to perceived injustice and suffering. This tension quickly converged through offline word-of-mouth and online social platform dissemination, forming intense group psychological imbalance. The collective cognition that "we can take to the streets, assemble, and protest to seek fair treatment for him" transformed this imbalance into powerful aggregated group drive [3].

Simultaneously, the public possessed simple collaborative action capability—agreeing on time and place via social platforms, requiring no complex resource integration. This satisfied the conditions for group benevolent action occurrence. Consequently, it gave rise to large-scale group benevolent action: People across the country took to the streets, assembling for peaceful protests, hoping the judiciary would handle the case prudently according to law. This formed a huge wave of public protest.

The core of this group behavior was to rescue an individual in distress through collective protest. In essence, it is a typical group empathetic benevolent action.

When the collective protest attracted attention from all sectors of society, and the related handling entered a space for consultation and consideration, the group psychological imbalance gradually eased. The aggregated group drive also disappeared. Protesting people gained a group sense of achievement and psychological satisfaction from "collective action bringing hope to the person involved." This is highly consistent with the psychological experience of group benevolent action in disaster relief. It further confirms the core logic of group empathetic benevolent action.

Different from rapid, instinctive, emotion-dominated good deeds like saving someone from drowning, the group psychological imbalance triggered by group empathy and need for help is dominated by cognitive factors, assisted by emotional factors. It can be categorized as cognitive dissonance [2]. It is the result of the interweaving and joint action of cognition and emotion.

Both cases of group benevolent action prove that their core logic is highly consistent with individual empathetic benevolent action. They only have group-level characteristics in the way empathy is transmitted, the form of psychological imbalance manifestation, the path of drive aggregation, and the method of action implementation. They are an effective extension and verification of this theory at the group level.

III. The Original Core Viewpoints of This Paper

Original new concept of empathy: Empathy is not a product of acquired education. It is a fundamental, instinctive emotional consciousness formed by humans during the long process of evolution to ensure group survival. The visual center, auditory center, and pain center are highly and precisely connected. This precise connection is the physiological basis of empathy. For example, when an individual sees or hears another person in distress, through the precise connection between the visual or auditory center and the pain center, the pain center produces a physiological response (a negative reaction). This physiological response, after rapid, active, and automatic processing by the brain, leads the individual to experience psychological pain. This is painful empathy. Conversely, seeing or hearing another person happy causes the pain center to produce the opposite reaction (a positive reaction), corresponding to joyful empathy.

Empathy is the core empathic consciousness innate to humans, divided into individual empathy and group empathy. Group empathy is the social extension of individual empathy. Together they constitute the psychological source of human benevolent actions and good deeds. Group empathy and group benevolent action can be divided into disaster relief type and social event type. Their core logic is highly unified.

Whether for an individual or a group, only when empathy and a real need for help appear simultaneously will it trigger the disruption of psychological balance (psychological imbalance) and the corresponding drive to restore balance. Empathy alone cannot directly produce the motivation for benevolent action.

Drive is the direct driving force for benevolent action. The drive for individual benevolent action originates from individual psychological imbalance. The drive for group benevolent action is the convergence and amplification of individual drives, i.e., aggregated group drive.

The occurrence of individual benevolent action requires satisfying "sufficient drive + the individual possesses the ability to implement" [1]. The occurrence of group benevolent action requires satisfying "aggregated group drive meets the standard + the group possesses collaborative action capability" [1].

Empathy without a real need for help will only trigger human emotional physiological reactions. It will not trigger psychological imbalance or the drive to restore balance [3]. Therefore, it cannot transform into real benevolent action.

The completion of a benevolent action will restore the individual's or group's psychological balance. The drive subsequently disappears. Simultaneously, it produces positive psychological experiences such as pleasure and a sense of achievement. This is the inevitable result after the restoration of psychological balance.

If one has the ability to implement a benevolent action but does not act due to insufficient drive, leading to a bad outcome, the individual or group will experience negative psychological experiences such as guilt and a sense of sin due to the unrestored psychological imbalance [2].

Individual good deeds in emergency situations like saving someone from drowning present immediate, sudden psychological imbalance. It forms rapidly, is absolutely dominated by emotional factors, with minimal cognitive involvement. It should not be simply classified as cognitive dissonance [2].

Deliberate extreme behavior and group benevolent action present persistent, cumulative psychological imbalance. After long-term psychological struggle and rational construction, they are dominated by cognitive factors. They belong to typical cognitive dissonance [2].

Although these two types of behavior differ significantly in psychological structure and mechanism, both are driven by empathy, with the fundamental goal of restoring psychological balance. Both can be completely and uniformly explained by this theory.


IV. The Theory of Inherent Goodness of Human Nature Based on the Empathy–Psychological Imbalance–Drive Theory

The analysis of the mechanisms of individual benevolent action, extreme behavior, group empathy, and group benevolent action above jointly provides systematic psychological evidence for the "inherent goodness of human nature" from the perspective of this theory.

The Empathy–Psychological Imbalance–Drive theory proposed in this paper can not only systematically explain the occurrence mechanisms of individual conventional benevolent action, individual extreme behavior, and individual non-benevolent action. It can also effectively explain the underlying logic of the two types of group empathetic benevolent action.

From individual to group, from conventional to special, from disaster relief to social events, it further improves the psychological argument for the "inherent goodness of human nature." It makes the theoretical explanatory boundary broader and the argument more sufficient.

First, empathy is an innate human emotional response ability. It is not simply shaped by acquired education. It is the core empathic consciousness preserved by humans in evolution, directed at the feelings of others. It exists both at the individual level and can form group empathy through emotional contagion and cognitive resonance.

The innateness and universality of this empathic consciousness are the core physiological and psychological foundation of the inherent goodness of human nature.

Whether it is an individual's empathy for the suffering of people around them, or a group's empathy for people in distant disaster areas or those involved in social events, in essence, they are external manifestations of the good (goodness) inherent in human nature.

This natural empathic consciousness, which does not require deliberate indoctrination, enables humans to care for and sympathize with others. It becomes the original and most core source of altruistic behavior and benevolent actions. It confirms that human nature has an innate tendency for mutual aid and inclination towards good.

Second, the process by which empathy triggers psychological imbalance and then produces the drive to restore balance is automatic, spontaneous, and natural [3].

This core logic applies to all benevolent actions driven by empathy. This includes individual immediate conventional benevolent action, deliberate individual extreme behavior, and group collaborative benevolent action in disaster relief and social events.

In essence, drive is the internal force driving individuals or groups to rescue others, implement benevolent actions, alleviate psychological imbalance, and restore psychological balance [1].

The widespread existence of this force indicates: Humans are born with a motivational tendency towards good and altruism.

Even in extreme situations where drive intensity reaches the extreme and breaks through conventional behavioral boundaries, or in group benevolent actions presented in the form of aggregated drive, the core motivational kernel for good behind the behavior is highly consistent with conventional individual benevolent action. Only the manifestation form and intensity level of empathy and drive differ, not the essence of the motivation. This further confirms: Altruism and inclination towards good are common innate instincts of humans.

Third, implementing conventional benevolent actions naturally produces pleasure. Group benevolent actions form group pleasure and a sense of achievement. However, when one has the ability to rescue but does not act, the individual feels guilt and a sense of sin [2]. Groups also feel collective guilt due to collective inaction.

This contrast fully shows: Acting in accordance with good conforms to the inherent psychological balance laws of human individuals and groups. Violating good disrupts this psychological balance [2].

The universality of this psychological experience exists not only at the individual level but also extends to the group level. It is reflected in the two types of group benevolent action, disaster relief and social events. It confirms: Good is the inherent psychological pursuit of humans. It is the instinctive choice to maintain one's own and the group's psychological balance.

Humans gain psychological satisfaction from helping others. They feel guilty for ignoring the suffering of others. This is not the passive result of external moral discipline. It is an inherent psychological characteristic of human nature itself. It proves the objectivity of the inherent goodness of human nature from the dual psychological experiences of individuals and groups.

In summary, the innateness and universality of empathic consciousness, the spontaneity and unity of drive, and the inevitability of the positive/negative psychological experiences brought by acting in accordance with good or not, together form a complete logical chain:

Humans are born with the instinct and motivation for good. This instinct and motivation are reflected in various altruistic benevolent actions and deeds in individual situations. They are also reflected in collaborative mutual aid behaviors in group situations. This is the common nature of humans.

Individual extreme behavior and various types of group empathetic benevolent action are only specific manifestations of this universal tendency in different situations.

This is the theory of the inherent goodness of human nature argued and clarified in this paper.

The occurrence paths of individual conventional benevolent action, individual extreme behavior, and group empathetic benevolent action proposed in this paper, along with the Empathy–Psychological Imbalance–Drive theory, argue fully for the inherent necessity of the inherent goodness of human nature and the broad explanatory power of the theory. This is done from individual to group, from conventional to special, from immediate reaction to deep consideration, from disaster relief to social events.

The inherent goodness of human nature is not a subjective moral assumption. Nor is it a result of acquired education. It is an objective fact that conforms to the basic principles of psychology [1,2,3].

It is rooted in the innate empathic consciousness of humans. It follows the basic laws of psychological balance and drive. It is the inevitable product formed by the human brain in the long process of evolution.

The inherent attribute of the goodness of human nature determines that the human tendency towards good has universality, stability, and spontaneity. This is also the core human foundation for human society to form cooperative relationships, build a harmonious community, and achieve sustainable development.

Furthermore, benevolent actions and deeds, whether at the individual or group level, are in essence the actual manifestation of the innate goodness of human nature.

This deep-seated tendency for mutual aid and inclination towards good, inherent in human nature, is the most fundamental, underlying foundation for the entire society to move forward and advance to higher levels.

Without the widespread existence of the motivation for good and mutual aid behavior among individuals and groups, social order would be difficult to maintain. Civilizational progress would have no basis. The ideal of human development to a higher stage would also lose its most solid psychological foundation and behavioral support.

Joyful empathy can also gradually give rise to benevolent actions. This process can also be explained by the Empathy–Psychological Imbalance–Drive theory of this paper. It will not be discussed further here.

V. Conclusion

This paper starts from the complete motivational chain of empathy → psychological imbalance → drive → benevolent action. Combining the basic principles of psychology, it rigorously argues for the profound proposition of the inherent goodness of human nature.

In the thousands of years of Chinese intellectual tradition, countless ancient sages had already profoundly revealed and firmly passed down the truth of the inherent goodness of human nature.

Confucius said: "By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart." [4]

Mencius said: "The feeling of commiseration is common to all men." [5]

The French thinker Rousseau believed: "In the state of nature, man is naturally endowed with pity. This is the source of all human virtues." [6]

The British thinker Locke pointed out: "The law of nature teaches us that all men are equal and independent. No one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions. Human nature is inherently inclined towards peace and good." [7]

The American thinker Emerson proposed: "The depth of human nature has divinity and goodness. Inclination towards good is the soul's original tendency." [8]

The representative of humanistic psychology, Rogers, firmly believed: "The human organism is inherently inclined towards self-actualization and good." [9]

Maslow also pointed out: "The higher needs of human nature include truth, goodness, and beauty. Self-actualizing people naturally possess altruistic and friendly traits." [10]

Thus, it can be seen that throughout history, great thinkers and theorists from East and West have, in different ways, revealed the same unbreakable truth: Human nature is inherently good.

This truth transcends time and space, surpasses ethnicity, and connects ancient and modern times. It is the spiritual foundation for the continuous development of Chinese civilization. It is also the common value pursuit of human civilization.

Here, we pay the highest respect to all great philosophers and pioneers, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, who pursued truth,崇尚goodness, and benefited humanity!

共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论，论证人性本善

摘要

传统道德心理学长期未能揭示共情转化为善行善举的内在动力机制，致使 “人性本善” 长期停留在哲学思辨层面，缺乏严谨的科学实证与理论证明。本文首次原创共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论模型，系统构建共情、心理失衡、内驱力与善行之间完整的动力链条，从个体紧急善行、深思型极端善行、灾害救助群体善行、社会事件群体善行等多种场景，统一解释人类善性行为的发生规律。

本文严格遵循动机心理学、认知失调理论、驱力降低理论与社会学习理论的基本原理，首次以心理学逻辑证明：人性本善并非主观道德假设，而是人类先天具有的心理本能。本文融通以孔孟为代表的东方心性智慧，与卢梭、洛克、爱默生、罗杰斯、马斯洛等西方思想家相互印证。

本研究填补了国际道德心理学领域长期存在的理论空白，理论简洁、逻辑严密，解释力极强，具有重要的原创价值、时代价值与人类文明价值。

一、理论基础

1.1共情的演化与神经基础

共情并非后天教育的产物，而是人类在漫长演化过程中为确保群体生存而形成的基本的本能性的情感意识。视觉中枢与听觉中枢与痛觉中枢高度精准连接，这种精密联结，是共情的生理基础。例如，当个体看到或听到他人处于困境时，通过视觉中枢或听觉中枢与痛觉中枢的精密联结，痛觉中枢会产生生理性反应（负向反应），这种生理性反应再经过大脑快速、主动的自动化加工，个体体验到心理的痛苦，此为痛苦共情；反之，看到或听到他人快乐时，痛觉中枢产生相反的反应（正向反应），对应快乐共情。

这种能力不仅存在于个体层面，还能通过情绪感染与认知共鸣形成群体共情，成为人类群体互助合作的心理基础，保障人类在演化过程中得以群体生存与发展。

1.2 心理平衡破坏机制（弹簧形变模型）

当共情（感知他人痛苦）与 “求助需要” 这一特定情境同时出现时，就会触发心理平衡破坏，也即心理失衡。这种失衡直接表现为内心紧张、不安、难受，驱动个体主动采取行动以恢复平衡。
群体共情下的心理失衡，是个体心理失衡的集体呈现：当一个群体共同感知到某一对象的痛苦与求助需要，并形成 “我们有能力提供帮助” 的集体认知时，群体心理紧张便会产生，进而推动群体层面的善举发生。

1.3 内驱力：恢复平衡的核心动机

由心理失衡所产生的内在紧张，会转化为内驱力。根据驱力降低理论 [3]，内驱力的核心功能就是消除紧张、恢复平衡。

内驱力强度与共情强度、需要显著性、个体 / 群体能力判断呈正相关。群体共情所产生的内驱力，是个体内驱力的汇聚与放大，每个人的心理张力相互叠加，形成更强的集体行动动力，并在社会认同、共同责任与情感联结的作用下进一步增强。

1.4 行为发生的一般原理

动机驱动行为，是心理学的经典基本原理。美国心理学家 R.S. 武德沃斯（1918）最早系统提出：动机是激发、维持、引导个体行为的内在动力 [1]，这一观点已成为心理学界的基本共识。

任何外显行为的发生，必须同时满足两个基本条件：动机足够 + 具备执行能力。仅有动机不足以必然产生行为；只有当内在动机强度突破个体行为抑制阈限，且个体在现实中具备身体条件、资源条件、环境条件与行动可能性时，动机才能稳定转化为可观察的行为。

群体共情与群体善行同样遵循这一原理：群体内驱力足够 + 群体协同行动能力具备。当群体形成统一的向善动机，并具备资源整合、行动协同的客观条件时，群体善举就会发生。这是个体行为规律在群体层面的延伸与体现。

二、本文核心理论规律

2.1 个体常规共情善行发生路径（救人案例）

共情 + 求助需要 → 心理平衡破坏（心理失衡） → 恢复平衡的内驱力 → 内驱力足够 + 救助能力具备 → 善行发生 → 心理平衡恢复，内驱力消失，产生愉悦感

原理解释：

心理学基本规律表明，行为由动机驱动，只有动机足够且个体具备实施能力，动机才能转化为实际行为 [1]。

动机来源于心理平衡被破坏。共情本身并不必然导致心理失衡。例如，人们在电影院看电影时虽产生强烈共情、甚至流泪，但并不会触发心理失衡，也不会产生行善动机与对应行为。

那么，共情何时触发心理失衡？

只有共情与真实的求助需要同时出现，原有心理平衡才会被打破，产生心理失衡与恢复平衡的内驱力，如同弹簧发生形变，产生恢复原态的弹力，这一内驱力就是动机。

本文所说的求助需要，指他人在现实场景中真实处于困境、危险或痛苦之中，客观上需要他人采取实际行动进行救助、帮助与干预。因为共情，旁观者产生帮助需要；若无共情，旁观者则不会产生这一需要。

当旁观者产生帮助需要却未在现实中实施帮助、需要未被满足时，就会触发心理失衡，进而产生恢复平衡的内驱力。心理失衡如同弹簧形变，会自然产生恢复平衡的内驱力 [3]。

内驱力产生，是否必然导致救助行为？其实未必。旁观者众多，但真正出手救人的往往只有少数一两人。原因在于：尽管所有旁观者都产生了内驱力，但因心理特质不同，每个人内驱力强度不同。能够成功救人者，一定是内驱力足够强、足以克服施救风险的人。

内驱力足够强，是否必然导致救助行为？依然未必。

生活中常见现象：孩子落水，母亲在岸边痛哭呼救，却不跳水救人。母亲最爱孩子，救助动机最强，但她为何不跳？

根本原因在于：母亲不会游泳，不具备救助能力。她只能向周围呼喊，期待有能力者施救。母亲清楚自己无能力施救，也明白盲目下水无法救回孩子，因此只能呼救。如果母亲会游泳且具备救助能力，她会毫不犹豫施救。换言之，在旁观者中，会游泳且具备救助能力的人，在足够强的内驱力驱动下，会实施救助行为。

像落水救人这类快速发生的个体善行，其背后的心理失衡是否完全属于认知失调 [2] 范畴，仍有待未来进一步研究；这类行为缺乏理性认知思考的时间与过程，简单将其归为认知失调，似乎难以契合现实行为的发生逻辑。这一问题可留给后续研究者深入验证。

以上均为生活中常见事实，完全符合动机心理学基本原理 [1]：
当动机足够强，且具备实施行为的能力时，行为就会发生。

当孩子被成功救起，施救者会如释重负，旁观者也会由衷欢呼。原因在于：孩子获救后，痛苦共情的来源消失，由共情引发的心理失衡得以恢复，内驱力自然消失，随之产生轻松愉悦的体验，如同紧张的肌肉得到放松。

2.2 个体非善行发生路径（看电影哭泣案例）

共情 + 无求助需要 → 不产生心理失衡 → 不产生内驱力 → 不发生善行
共情 + 无求助需要 → 身心自动化反应（如哭泣）

原理解释：

在看电影场景中，尽管角色遭遇能够引发观众强烈共情，但该场景并不要求观众在现实中实施真实救助行为。因此，不会触发心理失衡，也不会产生恢复平衡的内驱力 [3]，自然不会产生行善动机与救助行为。

此时观众出现哭泣等身心反应，不受大脑意识控制，属于情绪性生理反射，并非由心理失衡驱动的善行善举。

2.3 个体内疚感发生路径

共情 + 求助需要 → 心理平衡破坏（心理失衡） → 产生内驱力 → 有能力实施善行却未实施 → 不良结果 → 心理失衡未恢复 → 产生内疚（乃至罪恶感）

原理解释：
在这一路径中，个体有能力实施善行却未行动，最终导致负面结果（如当事人伤亡）。此时，负面结果与原本引发共情的痛苦来源叠加，形成新的、更强的痛苦来源，触发更强烈的痛苦共情。

与此同时，原本的求助需要未被满足，心理失衡状态持续存在，内驱力依然存在。
心理失衡状态的持续存在本身，就是重要的痛苦来源。

这些痛苦相互叠加，再加上道德判断，自然产生内疚、悔恨乃至罪恶感。这种因认知与行为不一致导致的持续不适，是典型的认知失调 [2] 体验。

特别说明：

如果个体已尽力施救却最终失败，当事人仍遭遇不幸，痛苦来源依然存在，负面情绪依然存在，但不会产生内疚与罪恶感。
因为个体已满足内驱力的要求，心理失衡得到缓解，道德判断上不存在 “有能力却不作为”，因此只有悲痛，无内疚与罪恶感。

2.4 个体极端共情相关行为发生路径

极端共情 + 群体求助需要 → 极度心理平衡破坏（心理失衡） → 超强恢复平衡内驱力 → 内驱力突破常规行为边界阈限 + 具备客观行动能力 → 极端行为发生 → 心理平衡阶段性恢复，内驱力阶段性释放

原理解释：

极端行为不同于常规个体紧急善行，是个体在感知他人持续痛苦与求助需要后，经过深思熟虑、突破常规行为边界所实施的行为。

这类行为的核心前提包含两个不可或缺的要素：一是弱势群体面临现实困境，存在迫切、强烈且未被满足的救助需要；二是行为主体具有强烈、真挚、无法抑制的救助他人、改变不公平现状的内在需要。

这种认知与情感的长期反复冲击，加上强烈的求助需要，使其内心形成强烈的内在紧张，进而触发极度心理失衡与对应的超强恢复平衡内驱力 [3]。

与落水救人等快速、本能、情绪主导的善行不同，这种心理失衡是个体深思熟虑后形成的，本质上属于认知失调 [2]，但同时包含极强的情绪因素，是认知与情感高度交织的深层心理失衡，不同于紧急情境下的即时性心理失衡。
在深层心理失衡驱动下，个体产生超强恢复平衡内驱力，其强度远高于常规善行，足以突破个体对常规行为的边界认知与日常行为规则阈限，成为主导个体行为的核心动机 [1]。

路易吉・曼吉奥内正是在超强内驱力驱动下，经过深思熟虑实施了极端行为。其行为核心目的并非简单对抗或情绪宣泄，而是以此发出警示，推动不合理状况的改善，从根本上终止民众持续痛苦，回应弱势群体的救助需要，完成内心救助他人的使命，从而缓解内在紧张、恢复心理平衡。

这类极端行为发生后，由群体求助需要所引发的极度心理失衡会得到阶段性恢复，超强内驱力也会得到阶段性释放。

这类行为尽管在形式上超出常规，但其核心逻辑并未脱离本文理论框架：共情触发心理失衡，内驱力驱动行为以恢复平衡。只是在共情强度、心理失衡形成过程与内驱力水平上，与常规善行存在显著差异，是本理论在极端情境下的具体体现。

特别声明： 本文对路易吉・曼吉奥内事件的所有分析，仅从心理学视角探讨共情、心理失衡与内驱力驱动极端行为的内在机制，属于纯理论机制阐释。本文所有论述不构成对该暴力行为合法性与合理性的辩护，也不作为司法审判依据；本文不倡导、不支持任何暴力、违法、极端行为，相关分析仅用于心理学理论研究与机制阐释。

2.5 群体共情善行发生路径

群体共情 + 群体求助需要 → 群体心理平衡破坏 → 群体聚合内驱力 → 聚合内驱力达标 + 群体协同行动能力具备 → 群体善行发生 → 群体心理平衡恢复，集体内驱力消失，产生群体愉悦感 / 成就感

原理解释：

群体共情与群体善行是共情意识在群体层面的典型体现，是个体共情的社会延伸。
当某一社会事件引发广泛群体共情，并形成 “被救助对象具有明确求助需要、且群体具备协同救助能力” 的集体认知时，就会触发群体心理失衡，进而产生恢复平衡的内驱力，推动群体善行发生。

群体共情与群体善行可分为两大类：灾害救助类群体善行与社会事件类群体善行。两类案例均能清晰印证本文核心逻辑，使群体共情的论证更加完整。

案例 1：灾害救助中的群体善行 ——2024 京津冀暴雨中的民间自发救助

在 2024 京津冀暴雨灾害中，受灾地区群众面临房屋冲毁、物资短缺、生命危险等严重困境。其遭遇通过各类媒体渠道传播后，迅速引发全国范围的群体共情 —— 不同地区、不同职业的人们通过图文、视频感知到受灾群众的痛苦与求助需要，形成 “他们处境极度危险，需要外部帮助” 的集体认知。

这种群体共情与明确的群体求助需要相结合，触发群体层面的心理失衡：每个个体因共情产生的心理紧张通过网络互动、社会舆论形成集体共振，叠加为强烈的群体心理失衡，而 “我们可以通过捐款、捐物、现场支援提供帮助” 的集体认知，将这种群体心理失衡转化为群体聚合内驱力 [3]。

这种聚合内驱力并非个体内驱力的简单相加，而是通过社会认同、共同责任与情感联结被放大、增强，成为推动全社会协同向善的核心动机 [1]。

与此同时，中国完善的交通体系、成熟的公益组织、便捷的线上捐赠渠道，使社会群体具备高效的协同行动能力，满足 “聚合内驱力达标 + 群体协同行动能力具备” 的行为发生条件，进而催生全方位、多层次的群体善行：全国人民自发捐款捐物，民间救援队千里奔赴开展生命搜救，各界志愿者驰援灾区提供后勤保障，企业主动捐赠物资与救援设备……

当这些群体善行落地实施，受灾群众困难得到缓解、生命安全得到保障，群体心理失衡逐步恢复，群体聚合内驱力也随之消失。参与善行的群体成员共同体会到群体愉悦感与成就感 —— 这种心理体验不仅存在于奔赴现场的人们身上，即便仅参与线上捐赠的普通民众，也会因 “自己的行为为灾区提供了帮助” 而产生心理满足，这与个体善行后的愉悦感在本质上一致，是群体心理平衡恢复后的必然结果。

案例 2：社会事件中的群体善行 —— 路易吉・曼吉奥内事件引发的民众街头声援行动

路易吉・曼吉奥内事件经媒体充分曝光后，其行为背后为苦难民众发声的初衷迅速被广大民众感知与认同。

加之民众普遍认为他因此行为极可能被重判，形成 “这个年轻人为民众发声却面临致命惩罚，自身陷入极端生存困境，需要外部支持与帮助” 的集体认知，进而引发大规模群体共情。
这种群体共情与明确的求助需要相结合，触发群体层面的心理失衡：无数民众因感知不公与苦难产生个体心理紧张，这些紧张通过线下口口相传、线上社交平台传播迅速汇聚，形成强烈的群体心理失衡，而 “我们可以走上街头、集会声援，为他争取公正对待” 的集体认知，将这种失衡转化为强大的群体聚合内驱力 [3]。

与此同时，民众具备简单的协同行动能力 —— 通过社交平台约定时间地点，无需复杂资源整合，满足群体善行发生条件，进而催生大规模群体善行：全国各地民众纷纷走上街头，集会开展和平声援，期待司法机关依法审慎处理此案，形成巨大的民间声援浪潮。

这一群体行为的核心，是通过集体声援救助陷入困境的个体，本质上是典型的群体共情善行。

当民众集体声援引起社会各界关注，相关处理进入协商考量空间，群体心理失衡逐步缓解，群体聚合内驱力也随之消失。参与声援的民众会因 “集体行动为当事人带来希望” 而产生群体成就感与心理满足，这与灾害救助中群体善行的心理体验高度一致，进一步印证了群体共情善行的核心逻辑。

与落水救人等快速、本能、情绪主导的善行不同，这种由群体共情与求助需要引发的群体心理失衡，以认知因素为主导、情绪因素为辅助，可归入认知失调 [2] 范畴，是认知与情感相互交织、共同作用的结果。

两类群体善行案例均证明，其核心逻辑与个体共情善行高度一致，只是在共情传递方式、心理失衡呈现形态、内驱力聚合路径、行为实施方式上具有群体层面特征，是本理论在群体层面的有效延伸与验证。

三、本文原创核心观点

1.原创共情新概念：共情并非后天教育的产物，而是人类在漫长演化过程中为确保群体生存而形成的基本的本能性的情感意识。视觉中枢与听觉中枢与痛觉中枢高度精准连接，这种精密联结，是共情的生理基础。例如，当个体看到或听到他人处于困境时，通过视觉中枢或听觉中枢与痛觉中枢的精密联结，痛觉中枢会产生生理性反应（负向反应），这种生理性反应再经过大脑快速、主动的自动化加工，个体体验到心理的痛苦，此为痛苦共情；反之，看到或听到他人快乐时，痛觉中枢产生相反的反应（正向反应），对应快乐共情。
共情是人类先天具有的核心共情意识，分为个体共情与群体共情。群体共情是个体共情的社会延伸，二者共同构成人类善行善举的心理来源；群体共情与群体善行可分为灾害救助类与社会事件类，核心逻辑高度统一。

2.无论个体还是群体，只有共情与真实求助需要同时出现，才会触发心理平衡破坏（心理失衡）及对应的恢复平衡内驱力。单纯共情无法直接产生行善动机。

3.内驱力是善行的直接动力。个体善行的内驱力来源于个体心理失衡，群体善行的内驱力是个体内驱力的汇聚与放大，即群体聚合内驱力。

4.个体善行发生需满足 “内驱力足够 + 个体具备实施能力”[1]；群体善行发生需满足 “群体聚合内驱力达标 + 群体具备协同行动能力”[1]。

5.无真实求助需要的共情，只会引发人类情绪性生理反应，不会触发心理失衡及恢复平衡内驱力 [3]，因此无法转化为现实善行。

6.善行完成会使个体或群体心理平衡恢复，内驱力随之消失，并同时产生愉悦感、成就感等积极心理体验，这是心理平衡恢复后的必然结果。

7.若有能力实施善行却因内驱力不足未行动，并导致不良后果，个体或群体会因心理失衡未恢复，产生内疚、罪恶感等消极心理体验 [2]。

8.落水救人等紧急情境中的个体善行，呈现即时性、突发性心理失衡，形成迅速、以情绪因素绝对主导、认知参与极少，不应简单归为认知失调 [2]；深思型极端行为与群体善行，则呈现持续性、累积性心理失衡，经长期心理挣扎与理性建构后以认知因素为主导，属于典型认知失调 [2]。两类行为在心理结构与机制上虽差异显著，但均由共情驱动、以恢复心理平衡为根本目标，均可被本理论完整、统一地解释。

四、基于共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论的人性本善论

上述对个体善行、极端行为、群体共情与群体善行机制的分析，共同为本理论视角下的 “人性本善” 提供了系统的心理学依据。

本文提出的共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论，不仅能系统解释个体常规善行、个体极端行为、个体非善行的发生机制，还能有效解释两类群体共情善行的底层逻辑。
从个体到群体、从常规到特殊、从灾害救助到社会事件，进一步完善了对 “人性本善” 的心理学论证，使理论解释边界更宽广、论证更充分。

第一，共情是人类先天具有的情绪反应能力，并非后天教育简单塑造而成。它是人类在演化中保留的核心共情意识，指向他人感受，既存在于个体层面，又能通过情绪感染与认知共鸣形成群体共情。

这种共情意识的先天性与普遍性，是人性本善的核心生理与心理基础。

无论是个体对身边他人痛苦的共情，还是群体对远方灾区民众、社会事件中当事人的共情，本质上都是人性深处善的底色的外在体现。

这种无需刻意教化的天然共情意识，使人类能够关心、同情他人，成为利他行为与善行善举最初、最核心的来源，印证了人性具有与生俱来的互助与向善倾向。

第二，共情触发心理失衡、进而产生恢复平衡内驱力的过程，是自动、自发、自然的 [3]。

这一核心逻辑适用于所有共情驱动的善行，无论是个体即时性常规善行、深思熟虑后的个体极端行为，还是灾害救助、社会事件中的群体协同善行。

内驱力在本质上，就是驱动个体或群体救助他人、实施善举、缓解心理失衡、恢复心理平衡的内在动力 [1]。

这种动力的普遍存在表明：人类天生具有向善、利他的动机倾向。

即便在内驱力强度达到极致、突破常规行为边界的极端情境中，或是以内驱力聚合形式呈现的群体善行中，行为背后的向善动机内核，与常规个体善行高度一致，只是共情与内驱力的表现形式、强度等级不同，而非动机本质存在差异，进一步印证：利他与向善是人类共通的先天本能。

第三，人们实施常规善行会自然产生愉悦感，群体行善会形成群体愉悦感与成就感；而有能力救助却未行动时，个体则会产生内疚与罪恶感 [2]，群体也会因集体不作为产生集体内疚。

这一对比充分表明：行善符合人类个体与群体的内在心理平衡规律，违背善则会破坏这种心理平衡 [2]。
这种心理体验的普遍性不仅存在于个体层面，还延伸至群体层面，体现在灾害救助与社会事件两类群体善行之中，印证：善是人类的内在心理追求，是维持自身与群体心理平衡的本能选择。

人类从帮助他人中获得心理满足，因漠视他人痛苦而心生愧疚，这并非外在道德规训的被动结果，而是人性本身固有的心理特质，从个体与群体双重心理体验上证明了人性本善的客观性。

综上， 共情意识的先天性与普遍性、内驱力的自发性与统一性、行善与不作为所带来的积极 / 消极心理体验的必然性，共同构成完整逻辑链条：

人类天生具有向善的本能与动力，这种本能与动力体现在个体情境中的各类利他善行与善举，也体现在群体情境中的协同互助行为，这是人类的共同本性。

个体极端行为与各类群体共情善行，只是这一普遍倾向在不同情境下的具体表现形式。
这就是本文所论证与阐明的人性本善理论。

本文提出的个体常规善行、个体极端行为、群体共情善行的发生路径，以及共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论，从个体到群体、从常规到特殊、从即时反应到深思熟虑、从灾害救助到社会事件，充分论证了人性本善的内在必然性与理论的广泛解释力。

人性本善并非主观道德假设，也不是后天教育结果，而是符合心理学基本原理 [1,2,3] 的客观事实。

它植根于人类先天的共情意识，遵循心理平衡与内驱力的基本规律，是人类大脑在漫长演化过程中形成的必然产物。

人性本善的内在属性，决定了人类向善倾向具有普遍性、稳定性与自发性，这也是人类社会形成互助合作关系、构建和谐共同体、实现可持续发展的核心人性基础。

进而言之，无论是个体层面还是群体层面的善行善举，本质上都是人类先天善性的现实体现。

这种深植于人性深处的互助与向善倾向，是整个社会向前发展、迈向更高层次的最底层、最根本的基础。
若无个体与群体普遍存在的向善动机与互助行为，社会秩序难以维系，文明进步无从实现，人类向更高阶段发展的理想也将失去最坚实的心理基础与行为支撑。

快乐共情同样可以逐步催生善行善举，这一过程同样可以用本文的共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论解释，此处不再重复论述。

五、结语

本文从共情 → 心理失衡 → 内驱力 → 善行这一完整动力链条出发，结合心理学基本原理，严谨论证了人性本善这一深刻命题。

在中华数千年思想传统中，无数古代先贤早已深刻揭示并坚定传承人性本善的真理。
孔子曰：“性相近也，习相远也。”[4]
孟子曰：“恻隐之心，人皆有之。”[5]

法国思想家卢梭认为：“在自然状态中，人天生具有怜悯心，这是人类一切美德的源泉。”[6]

英国思想家洛克指出：“自然法教导我们，人人平等而独立，谁也不得侵害他人的生命、健康、自由或财产。人性天生具有和平与向善的倾向。”[7]

美国思想家爱默生提出：“人性深处具有神性与善，向善是灵魂的本来倾向。”[8]

人本主义心理学代表罗杰斯坚定认为：“人类有机体天生具有自我实现与向善的倾向。”[9]

马斯洛也指出：“人性的高级需要包括求真、求善、求美，自我实现的人天然具有利他与友善的特质。”[10]

由此可见，古往今来，东西方伟大的思想家、理论家，以不同方式揭示了同一条颠扑不破的真理：人性本善。

这一真理跨越时空、超越民族、贯通古今，既是中华文明不断发展的精神根基，也是人类文明共同的价值追求。

在此，谨向古今中外一切追求真理、崇尚善道、造福人类的伟大哲人与先驱，致以最崇高的敬意！

共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论，论证人性本善

摘要

传统道德心理学长期未能揭示共情转化为善行善举的内在动力机制，致使 “人性本善” 长期停留在哲学思辨层面，缺乏严谨的科学实证与理论证明。本文首次原创共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论模型，系统构建共情、心理失衡、内驱力与善行之间完整的动力链条，从个体紧急善行、深思型极端善行、灾害救助群体善行、社会事件群体善行等多种场景，统一解释人类善性行为的发生规律。

本文严格遵循动机心理学、认知失调理论、驱力降低理论与社会学习理论的基本原理，首次以心理学逻辑证明：人性本善并非主观道德假设，而是人类先天具有的心理本能。本文融通以孔孟为代表的东方心性智慧，与卢梭、洛克、爱默生、罗杰斯、马斯洛等西方思想家相互印证。

本研究填补了国际道德心理学领域长期存在的理论空白，理论简洁、逻辑严密，解释力极强，具有重要的原创价值、时代价值与人类文明价值。

一、理论基础

1.1共情的演化与神经基础

共情并非后天教育的产物，而是人类在漫长演化过程中为确保群体生存而形成的基本的本能性的情感意识。视觉中枢与听觉中枢与痛觉中枢高度精准连接，这种精密联结，是共情的生理基础。例如，当个体看到或听到他人处于困境时，通过视觉中枢或听觉中枢与痛觉中枢的精密联结，痛觉中枢会产生生理性反应（负向反应），这种生理性反应再经过大脑快速、主动的自动化加工，个体体验到心理的痛苦，此为痛苦共情；反之，看到或听到他人快乐时，痛觉中枢产生相反的反应（正向反应），对应快乐共情。

这种能力不仅存在于个体层面，还能通过情绪感染与认知共鸣形成群体共情，成为人类群体互助合作的心理基础，保障人类在演化过程中得以群体生存与发展。

1.2 心理平衡破坏机制（弹簧形变模型）

当共情（感知他人痛苦）与 “求助需要” 这一特定情境同时出现时，就会触发心理平衡破坏，也即心理失衡。这种失衡直接表现为内心紧张、不安、难受，驱动个体主动采取行动以恢复平衡。
群体共情下的心理失衡，是个体心理失衡的集体呈现：当一个群体共同感知到某一对象的痛苦与求助需要，并形成 “我们有能力提供帮助” 的集体认知时，群体心理紧张便会产生，进而推动群体层面的善举发生。

1.3 内驱力：恢复平衡的核心动机

由心理失衡所产生的内在紧张，会转化为内驱力。根据驱力降低理论 [3]，内驱力的核心功能就是消除紧张、恢复平衡。

内驱力强度与共情强度、需要显著性、个体 / 群体能力判断呈正相关。群体共情所产生的内驱力，是个体内驱力的汇聚与放大，每个人的心理张力相互叠加，形成更强的集体行动动力，并在社会认同、共同责任与情感联结的作用下进一步增强。

1.4 行为发生的一般原理

动机驱动行为，是心理学的经典基本原理。美国心理学家 R.S. 武德沃斯（1918）最早系统提出：动机是激发、维持、引导个体行为的内在动力 [1]，这一观点已成为心理学界的基本共识。

任何外显行为的发生，必须同时满足两个基本条件：动机足够 + 具备执行能力。仅有动机不足以必然产生行为；只有当内在动机强度突破个体行为抑制阈限，且个体在现实中具备身体条件、资源条件、环境条件与行动可能性时，动机才能稳定转化为可观察的行为。

群体共情与群体善行同样遵循这一原理：群体内驱力足够 + 群体协同行动能力具备。当群体形成统一的向善动机，并具备资源整合、行动协同的客观条件时，群体善举就会发生。这是个体行为规律在群体层面的延伸与体现。

二、本文核心理论规律

2.1 个体常规共情善行发生路径（救人案例）

共情 + 求助需要 → 心理平衡破坏（心理失衡） → 恢复平衡的内驱力 → 内驱力足够 + 救助能力具备 → 善行发生 → 心理平衡恢复，内驱力消失，产生愉悦感

原理解释：

心理学基本规律表明，行为由动机驱动，只有动机足够且个体具备实施能力，动机才能转化为实际行为 [1]。

动机来源于心理平衡被破坏。共情本身并不必然导致心理失衡。例如，人们在电影院看电影时虽产生强烈共情、甚至流泪，但并不会触发心理失衡，也不会产生行善动机与对应行为。

那么，共情何时触发心理失衡？

只有共情与真实的求助需要同时出现，原有心理平衡才会被打破，产生心理失衡与恢复平衡的内驱力，如同弹簧发生形变，产生恢复原态的弹力，这一内驱力就是动机。

本文所说的求助需要，指他人在现实场景中真实处于困境、危险或痛苦之中，客观上需要他人采取实际行动进行救助、帮助与干预。因为共情，旁观者产生帮助需要；若无共情，旁观者则不会产生这一需要。

当旁观者产生帮助需要却未在现实中实施帮助、需要未被满足时，就会触发心理失衡，进而产生恢复平衡的内驱力。心理失衡如同弹簧形变，会自然产生恢复平衡的内驱力 [3]。

内驱力产生，是否必然导致救助行为？其实未必。旁观者众多，但真正出手救人的往往只有少数一两人。原因在于：尽管所有旁观者都产生了内驱力，但因心理特质不同，每个人内驱力强度不同。能够成功救人者，一定是内驱力足够强、足以克服施救风险的人。

内驱力足够强，是否必然导致救助行为？依然未必。

生活中常见现象：孩子落水，母亲在岸边痛哭呼救，却不跳水救人。母亲最爱孩子，救助动机最强，但她为何不跳？

根本原因在于：母亲不会游泳，不具备救助能力。她只能向周围呼喊，期待有能力者施救。母亲清楚自己无能力施救，也明白盲目下水无法救回孩子，因此只能呼救。如果母亲会游泳且具备救助能力，她会毫不犹豫施救。换言之，在旁观者中，会游泳且具备救助能力的人，在足够强的内驱力驱动下，会实施救助行为。

像落水救人这类快速发生的个体善行，其背后的心理失衡是否完全属于认知失调 [2] 范畴，仍有待未来进一步研究；这类行为缺乏理性认知思考的时间与过程，简单将其归为认知失调，似乎难以契合现实行为的发生逻辑。这一问题可留给后续研究者深入验证。

以上均为生活中常见事实，完全符合动机心理学基本原理 [1]：
当动机足够强，且具备实施行为的能力时，行为就会发生。

当孩子被成功救起，施救者会如释重负，旁观者也会由衷欢呼。原因在于：孩子获救后，痛苦共情的来源消失，由共情引发的心理失衡得以恢复，内驱力自然消失，随之产生轻松愉悦的体验，如同紧张的肌肉得到放松。

2.2 个体非善行发生路径（看电影哭泣案例）

共情 + 无求助需要 → 不产生心理失衡 → 不产生内驱力 → 不发生善行
共情 + 无求助需要 → 身心自动化反应（如哭泣）

原理解释：

在看电影场景中，尽管角色遭遇能够引发观众强烈共情，但该场景并不要求观众在现实中实施真实救助行为。因此，不会触发心理失衡，也不会产生恢复平衡的内驱力 [3]，自然不会产生行善动机与救助行为。

此时观众出现哭泣等身心反应，不受大脑意识控制，属于情绪性生理反射，并非由心理失衡驱动的善行善举。

2.3 个体内疚感发生路径

共情 + 求助需要 → 心理平衡破坏（心理失衡） → 产生内驱力 → 有能力实施善行却未实施 → 不良结果 → 心理失衡未恢复 → 产生内疚（乃至罪恶感）

原理解释：
在这一路径中，个体有能力实施善行却未行动，最终导致负面结果（如当事人伤亡）。此时，负面结果与原本引发共情的痛苦来源叠加，形成新的、更强的痛苦来源，触发更强烈的痛苦共情。

与此同时，原本的求助需要未被满足，心理失衡状态持续存在，内驱力依然存在。
心理失衡状态的持续存在本身，就是重要的痛苦来源。

这些痛苦相互叠加，再加上道德判断，自然产生内疚、悔恨乃至罪恶感。这种因认知与行为不一致导致的持续不适，是典型的认知失调 [2] 体验。

特别说明：

如果个体已尽力施救却最终失败，当事人仍遭遇不幸，痛苦来源依然存在，负面情绪依然存在，但不会产生内疚与罪恶感。
因为个体已满足内驱力的要求，心理失衡得到缓解，道德判断上不存在 “有能力却不作为”，因此只有悲痛，无内疚与罪恶感。

2.4 个体极端共情相关行为发生路径

极端共情 + 群体求助需要 → 极度心理平衡破坏（心理失衡） → 超强恢复平衡内驱力 → 内驱力突破常规行为边界阈限 + 具备客观行动能力 → 极端行为发生 → 心理平衡阶段性恢复，内驱力阶段性释放

原理解释：

极端行为不同于常规个体紧急善行，是个体在感知他人持续痛苦与求助需要后，经过深思熟虑、突破常规行为边界所实施的行为。

这类行为的核心前提包含两个不可或缺的要素：一是弱势群体面临现实困境，存在迫切、强烈且未被满足的救助需要；二是行为主体具有强烈、真挚、无法抑制的救助他人、改变不公平现状的内在需要。

这种认知与情感的长期反复冲击，加上强烈的求助需要，使其内心形成强烈的内在紧张，进而触发极度心理失衡与对应的超强恢复平衡内驱力 [3]。

与落水救人等快速、本能、情绪主导的善行不同，这种心理失衡是个体深思熟虑后形成的，本质上属于认知失调 [2]，但同时包含极强的情绪因素，是认知与情感高度交织的深层心理失衡，不同于紧急情境下的即时性心理失衡。
在深层心理失衡驱动下，个体产生超强恢复平衡内驱力，其强度远高于常规善行，足以突破个体对常规行为的边界认知与日常行为规则阈限，成为主导个体行为的核心动机 [1]。

路易吉・曼吉奥内正是在超强内驱力驱动下，经过深思熟虑实施了极端行为。其行为核心目的并非简单对抗或情绪宣泄，而是以此发出警示，推动不合理状况的改善，从根本上终止民众持续痛苦，回应弱势群体的救助需要，完成内心救助他人的使命，从而缓解内在紧张、恢复心理平衡。

这类极端行为发生后，由群体求助需要所引发的极度心理失衡会得到阶段性恢复，超强内驱力也会得到阶段性释放。

这类行为尽管在形式上超出常规，但其核心逻辑并未脱离本文理论框架：共情触发心理失衡，内驱力驱动行为以恢复平衡。只是在共情强度、心理失衡形成过程与内驱力水平上，与常规善行存在显著差异，是本理论在极端情境下的具体体现。

特别声明： 本文对路易吉・曼吉奥内事件的所有分析，仅从心理学视角探讨共情、心理失衡与内驱力驱动极端行为的内在机制，属于纯理论机制阐释。本文所有论述不构成对该暴力行为合法性与合理性的辩护，也不作为司法审判依据；本文不倡导、不支持任何暴力、违法、极端行为，相关分析仅用于心理学理论研究与机制阐释。

2.5 群体共情善行发生路径

群体共情 + 群体求助需要 → 群体心理平衡破坏 → 群体聚合内驱力 → 聚合内驱力达标 + 群体协同行动能力具备 → 群体善行发生 → 群体心理平衡恢复，集体内驱力消失，产生群体愉悦感 / 成就感

原理解释：

群体共情与群体善行是共情意识在群体层面的典型体现，是个体共情的社会延伸。
当某一社会事件引发广泛群体共情，并形成 “被救助对象具有明确求助需要、且群体具备协同救助能力” 的集体认知时，就会触发群体心理失衡，进而产生恢复平衡的内驱力，推动群体善行发生。

群体共情与群体善行可分为两大类：灾害救助类群体善行与社会事件类群体善行。两类案例均能清晰印证本文核心逻辑，使群体共情的论证更加完整。

案例 1：灾害救助中的群体善行 ——2024 京津冀暴雨中的民间自发救助

在 2024 京津冀暴雨灾害中，受灾地区群众面临房屋冲毁、物资短缺、生命危险等严重困境。其遭遇通过各类媒体渠道传播后，迅速引发全国范围的群体共情 —— 不同地区、不同职业的人们通过图文、视频感知到受灾群众的痛苦与求助需要，形成 “他们处境极度危险，需要外部帮助” 的集体认知。

这种群体共情与明确的群体求助需要相结合，触发群体层面的心理失衡：每个个体因共情产生的心理紧张通过网络互动、社会舆论形成集体共振，叠加为强烈的群体心理失衡，而 “我们可以通过捐款、捐物、现场支援提供帮助” 的集体认知，将这种群体心理失衡转化为群体聚合内驱力 [3]。

这种聚合内驱力并非个体内驱力的简单相加，而是通过社会认同、共同责任与情感联结被放大、增强，成为推动全社会协同向善的核心动机 [1]。

与此同时，中国完善的交通体系、成熟的公益组织、便捷的线上捐赠渠道，使社会群体具备高效的协同行动能力，满足 “聚合内驱力达标 + 群体协同行动能力具备” 的行为发生条件，进而催生全方位、多层次的群体善行：全国人民自发捐款捐物，民间救援队千里奔赴开展生命搜救，各界志愿者驰援灾区提供后勤保障，企业主动捐赠物资与救援设备……

当这些群体善行落地实施，受灾群众困难得到缓解、生命安全得到保障，群体心理失衡逐步恢复，群体聚合内驱力也随之消失。参与善行的群体成员共同体会到群体愉悦感与成就感 —— 这种心理体验不仅存在于奔赴现场的人们身上，即便仅参与线上捐赠的普通民众，也会因 “自己的行为为灾区提供了帮助” 而产生心理满足，这与个体善行后的愉悦感在本质上一致，是群体心理平衡恢复后的必然结果。

案例 2：社会事件中的群体善行 —— 路易吉・曼吉奥内事件引发的民众街头声援行动

路易吉・曼吉奥内事件经媒体充分曝光后，其行为背后为苦难民众发声的初衷迅速被广大民众感知与认同。

加之民众普遍认为他因此行为极可能被重判，形成 “这个年轻人为民众发声却面临致命惩罚，自身陷入极端生存困境，需要外部支持与帮助” 的集体认知，进而引发大规模群体共情。
这种群体共情与明确的求助需要相结合，触发群体层面的心理失衡：无数民众因感知不公与苦难产生个体心理紧张，这些紧张通过线下口口相传、线上社交平台传播迅速汇聚，形成强烈的群体心理失衡，而 “我们可以走上街头、集会声援，为他争取公正对待” 的集体认知，将这种失衡转化为强大的群体聚合内驱力 [3]。

与此同时，民众具备简单的协同行动能力 —— 通过社交平台约定时间地点，无需复杂资源整合，满足群体善行发生条件，进而催生大规模群体善行：全国各地民众纷纷走上街头，集会开展和平声援，期待司法机关依法审慎处理此案，形成巨大的民间声援浪潮。

这一群体行为的核心，是通过集体声援救助陷入困境的个体，本质上是典型的群体共情善行。

当民众集体声援引起社会各界关注，相关处理进入协商考量空间，群体心理失衡逐步缓解，群体聚合内驱力也随之消失。参与声援的民众会因 “集体行动为当事人带来希望” 而产生群体成就感与心理满足，这与灾害救助中群体善行的心理体验高度一致，进一步印证了群体共情善行的核心逻辑。

与落水救人等快速、本能、情绪主导的善行不同，这种由群体共情与求助需要引发的群体心理失衡，以认知因素为主导、情绪因素为辅助，可归入认知失调 [2] 范畴，是认知与情感相互交织、共同作用的结果。

两类群体善行案例均证明，其核心逻辑与个体共情善行高度一致，只是在共情传递方式、心理失衡呈现形态、内驱力聚合路径、行为实施方式上具有群体层面特征，是本理论在群体层面的有效延伸与验证。

三、本文原创核心观点

1.原创共情新概念：共情并非后天教育的产物，而是人类在漫长演化过程中为确保群体生存而形成的基本的本能性的情感意识。视觉中枢与听觉中枢与痛觉中枢高度精准连接，这种精密联结，是共情的生理基础。例如，当个体看到或听到他人处于困境时，通过视觉中枢或听觉中枢与痛觉中枢的精密联结，痛觉中枢会产生生理性反应（负向反应），这种生理性反应再经过大脑快速、主动的自动化加工，个体体验到心理的痛苦，此为痛苦共情；反之，看到或听到他人快乐时，痛觉中枢产生相反的反应（正向反应），对应快乐共情。
共情是人类先天具有的核心共情意识，分为个体共情与群体共情。群体共情是个体共情的社会延伸，二者共同构成人类善行善举的心理来源；群体共情与群体善行可分为灾害救助类与社会事件类，核心逻辑高度统一。

2.无论个体还是群体，只有共情与真实求助需要同时出现，才会触发心理平衡破坏（心理失衡）及对应的恢复平衡内驱力。单纯共情无法直接产生行善动机。

3.内驱力是善行的直接动力。个体善行的内驱力来源于个体心理失衡，群体善行的内驱力是个体内驱力的汇聚与放大，即群体聚合内驱力。

4.个体善行发生需满足 “内驱力足够 + 个体具备实施能力”[1]；群体善行发生需满足 “群体聚合内驱力达标 + 群体具备协同行动能力”[1]。

5.无真实求助需要的共情，只会引发人类情绪性生理反应，不会触发心理失衡及恢复平衡内驱力 [3]，因此无法转化为现实善行。

6.善行完成会使个体或群体心理平衡恢复，内驱力随之消失，并同时产生愉悦感、成就感等积极心理体验，这是心理平衡恢复后的必然结果。

7.若有能力实施善行却因内驱力不足未行动，并导致不良后果，个体或群体会因心理失衡未恢复，产生内疚、罪恶感等消极心理体验 [2]。

8.落水救人等紧急情境中的个体善行，呈现即时性、突发性心理失衡，形成迅速、以情绪因素绝对主导、认知参与极少，不应简单归为认知失调 [2]；深思型极端行为与群体善行，则呈现持续性、累积性心理失衡，经长期心理挣扎与理性建构后以认知因素为主导，属于典型认知失调 [2]。两类行为在心理结构与机制上虽差异显著，但均由共情驱动、以恢复心理平衡为根本目标，均可被本理论完整、统一地解释。

四、基于共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论的人性本善论

上述对个体善行、极端行为、群体共情与群体善行机制的分析，共同为本理论视角下的 “人性本善” 提供了系统的心理学依据。

本文提出的共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论，不仅能系统解释个体常规善行、个体极端行为、个体非善行的发生机制，还能有效解释两类群体共情善行的底层逻辑。
从个体到群体、从常规到特殊、从灾害救助到社会事件，进一步完善了对 “人性本善” 的心理学论证，使理论解释边界更宽广、论证更充分。

第一，共情是人类先天具有的情绪反应能力，并非后天教育简单塑造而成。它是人类在演化中保留的核心共情意识，指向他人感受，既存在于个体层面，又能通过情绪感染与认知共鸣形成群体共情。

这种共情意识的先天性与普遍性，是人性本善的核心生理与心理基础。

无论是个体对身边他人痛苦的共情，还是群体对远方灾区民众、社会事件中当事人的共情，本质上都是人性深处善的底色的外在体现。

这种无需刻意教化的天然共情意识，使人类能够关心、同情他人，成为利他行为与善行善举最初、最核心的来源，印证了人性具有与生俱来的互助与向善倾向。

第二，共情触发心理失衡、进而产生恢复平衡内驱力的过程，是自动、自发、自然的 [3]。

这一核心逻辑适用于所有共情驱动的善行，无论是个体即时性常规善行、深思熟虑后的个体极端行为，还是灾害救助、社会事件中的群体协同善行。

内驱力在本质上，就是驱动个体或群体救助他人、实施善举、缓解心理失衡、恢复心理平衡的内在动力 [1]。

这种动力的普遍存在表明：人类天生具有向善、利他的动机倾向。

即便在内驱力强度达到极致、突破常规行为边界的极端情境中，或是以内驱力聚合形式呈现的群体善行中，行为背后的向善动机内核，与常规个体善行高度一致，只是共情与内驱力的表现形式、强度等级不同，而非动机本质存在差异，进一步印证：利他与向善是人类共通的先天本能。

第三，人们实施常规善行会自然产生愉悦感，群体行善会形成群体愉悦感与成就感；而有能力救助却未行动时，个体则会产生内疚与罪恶感 [2]，群体也会因集体不作为产生集体内疚。

这一对比充分表明：行善符合人类个体与群体的内在心理平衡规律，违背善则会破坏这种心理平衡 [2]。
这种心理体验的普遍性不仅存在于个体层面，还延伸至群体层面，体现在灾害救助与社会事件两类群体善行之中，印证：善是人类的内在心理追求，是维持自身与群体心理平衡的本能选择。

人类从帮助他人中获得心理满足，因漠视他人痛苦而心生愧疚，这并非外在道德规训的被动结果，而是人性本身固有的心理特质，从个体与群体双重心理体验上证明了人性本善的客观性。

综上， 共情意识的先天性与普遍性、内驱力的自发性与统一性、行善与不作为所带来的积极 / 消极心理体验的必然性，共同构成完整逻辑链条：

人类天生具有向善的本能与动力，这种本能与动力体现在个体情境中的各类利他善行与善举，也体现在群体情境中的协同互助行为，这是人类的共同本性。

个体极端行为与各类群体共情善行，只是这一普遍倾向在不同情境下的具体表现形式。
这就是本文所论证与阐明的人性本善理论。

本文提出的个体常规善行、个体极端行为、群体共情善行的发生路径，以及共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论，从个体到群体、从常规到特殊、从即时反应到深思熟虑、从灾害救助到社会事件，充分论证了人性本善的内在必然性与理论的广泛解释力。

人性本善并非主观道德假设，也不是后天教育结果，而是符合心理学基本原理 [1,2,3] 的客观事实。

它植根于人类先天的共情意识，遵循心理平衡与内驱力的基本规律，是人类大脑在漫长演化过程中形成的必然产物。

人性本善的内在属性，决定了人类向善倾向具有普遍性、稳定性与自发性，这也是人类社会形成互助合作关系、构建和谐共同体、实现可持续发展的核心人性基础。

进而言之，无论是个体层面还是群体层面的善行善举，本质上都是人类先天善性的现实体现。

这种深植于人性深处的互助与向善倾向，是整个社会向前发展、迈向更高层次的最底层、最根本的基础。
若无个体与群体普遍存在的向善动机与互助行为，社会秩序难以维系，文明进步无从实现，人类向更高阶段发展的理想也将失去最坚实的心理基础与行为支撑。

快乐共情同样可以逐步催生善行善举，这一过程同样可以用本文的共情 — 心理失衡 — 内驱力理论解释，此处不再重复论述。

五、结语

本文从共情 → 心理失衡 → 内驱力 → 善行这一完整动力链条出发，结合心理学基本原理，严谨论证了人性本善这一深刻命题。

在中华数千年思想传统中，无数古代先贤早已深刻揭示并坚定传承人性本善的真理。
孔子曰：“性相近也，习相远也。”[4]
孟子曰：“恻隐之心，人皆有之。”[5]

法国思想家卢梭认为：“在自然状态中，人天生具有怜悯心，这是人类一切美德的源泉。”[6]

英国思想家洛克指出：“自然法教导我们，人人平等而独立，谁也不得侵害他人的生命、健康、自由或财产。人性天生具有和平与向善的倾向。”[7]

美国思想家爱默生提出：“人性深处具有神性与善，向善是灵魂的本来倾向。”[8]

人本主义心理学代表罗杰斯坚定认为：“人类有机体天生具有自我实现与向善的倾向。”[9]

马斯洛也指出：“人性的高级需要包括求真、求善、求美，自我实现的人天然具有利他与友善的特质。”[10]

由此可见，古往今来，东西方伟大的思想家、理论家，以不同方式揭示了同一条颠扑不破的真理：人性本善。

这一真理跨越时空、超越民族、贯通古今，既是中华文明不断发展的精神根基，也是人类文明共同的价值追求。

在此，谨向古今中外一切追求真理、崇尚善道、造福人类的伟大哲人与先驱，致以最崇高的敬意！
